## General Rules

- Read CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines on how to run tools
- Before making implementation or product decisions, consult DESIGN.md
- If the decision is not covered by DESIGN.md, ask instead of guessing
- ALWAYS attempt to add a test case for changed behavior
- PREFER integration tests, e.g., at `it/...` over unit tests
- PREFER `insta` snapshots following patterns in nearby tests over substring assertions
- PREFER running specific tests over running the entire test suite
- AVOID using `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `.unwrap()`, unsafe code, and clippy rule ignores
- PREFER patterns like `if let` to handle fallibility
- ALWAYS write `SAFETY` comments following our usual style when writing `unsafe` code
- PREFER `#[expect()]` over `[allow()]` if clippy must be disabled
- PREFER let chains (`if let` combined with `&&`) over nested `if let` statements
- NEVER update all dependencies in the lockfile and ALWAYS use `cargo update --precise` to make
  lockfile changes
- NEVER assume clippy warnings are pre-existing, it is very rare that `main` has warnings
- ALWAYS read and copy the style of similar tests when adding new cases
- PREFER top-level imports over local imports or fully qualified names
- AVOID shortening variable names, e.g., use `version` instead of `ver`
- PREFER [`TypeName`] references when writing Rust doc comments

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- consult DESIGN.md
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## Surgical Changes

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Conventional Commits

- Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat, fix, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
- The type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
- The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
- A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):
- A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string.
- A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
- A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.
- One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git trailer convention).
- A footer’s token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.
- A footer’s value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
- Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.
- If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.
- If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the :. If ! is used, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.
- Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: update ref docs.
- The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case-sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.
- BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer.
